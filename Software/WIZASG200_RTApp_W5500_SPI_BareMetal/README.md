Real-time (RT) capable application run on bare metal or with a real-time operating system on the real-time cores.
In ASG200, RTApp (Real-time capable Application) is `RTApp_W5500_SPI_BareMetal_WIZASG200` and it controls WIZnet W5500 ethernet chip and provides variety protocol communications with legacy devices on brown field. Also, it performs inter-core communication between RTApp and HLApp (High-level Application).

`RTApp_W5500_SPI_BareMetal_WIZASG200` is performed as the followed:

- WIZnet W5500 SPI control
  - Local network communication with brown field
  - Ethernet interface
  - TCP Server for data communication with brown field
  - DHCP Server for local network address configuration of brown field
  - SNTP Server for time information management
- Inter-core communication
  - Send the parsing data from brown field to HLApp
